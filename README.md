# Competitor-Analysis

Python script to determine brand image and quantify consumer sentiments towards a brand on social media as compared to its competitors using Tweepy & TextBlob (NLTK) libraries

In the Walmart and Kroger Example,
Kroger can see it needs to work on long queues at the store, and it needs to be more active on social media like Walmart it and make itself more acceptable amongst its customers. This will help Kroger gain customer mind share and make its brand image better.
